## add-rule
Calls the iptables command to add (-A) a rule to the INPUT chain of the
iptable. This rule will drop tcp packets (-p tcp) and is a match rule for tcp
packets (-m tcp) with the destination port as port 80 (--dport 80). The rule
sets up sting with the necessary parameters (key, ratio, src-prefix4,
src-prefix6) and sets the target to TARPIT. For details on sting and its
parameters see the sting man page.

## add-sting
Adds the sting module.

## readd-sting
Removes and then adds back the sting module by calling the remove-sting and
add-sting scripts.

## remove-sting
Deletes all of the rules associated with sting and removes the sting module.

## test-sting
Runs nmap on localhost and uses relevent information about the ports that are
closed and open to come up with a ratio. This experimental ratio can be
compared with the ratio set by the add-rule script to verify that sting is
dropping packets at the correct rate.
