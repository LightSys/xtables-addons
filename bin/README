##add-rule
Calls the iptables command to add (-A) a rule to the INPUT chain of the iptable. This rule will drop tcp packets (-p tcp) and is a match rule for tcp packets (-m tcp) with the destination port as port 80 (--dport 80). The rule sets up TARHASH with the necessary parameters (key, ratio, src-prefix4, src-prefix6) and sets the target to TARPIT. For details on TARHASH and its parameters see the TARHASH man page.

##add-tarhash
Adds the TARHASH module.

##readd-tarhash
Removes and then adds back the TARHASH module by calling the remove-tarhash and add-tarhash scripts.

##remove-tarhash
Deletes all of the rules associated with TARHASH and removes the TARHASH module.

##test-tarhash
Runs nmap on localhost and uses relevent information about the ports that are closed and open to come up with a ratio. This experimental ratio can be compared with the ratio set by the add-rule script to verify that TARHASH is dropping packets at the correct rate.
